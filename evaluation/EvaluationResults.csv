In the context of human biological populations, demographic analysis uses administrative records to develop an independent estimate of the population.  Demographic analysis estimates are often considered a reliable standard for judging the accuracy of the census information gathered at any time.  In the labor force, demographic analysis is used to estimate sizes and flows of populations of workers; in population ecology the focus is on the birth, death, migration and immigration of individuals in a population of living organisms, alternatively, in social human sciences could involve movement of firms and institutional forms.  Demographic analysis is used in a wide variety of contexts.  For example, it is often used in business plans, to describe the population connected to the geographic location of the business.  Demographic analysis is usually abbreviated as DA.  For the 2010 U.S. Census, The U.S. Census Bureau has expanded its DA categories.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  ""Composition"" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music ""score"", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.', 'In sound recording and reproduction, audio mixing is the process of combining multitrack recordings into a single track.

These methods have primarily been developed to study human populations, but are extended to a variety of areas where researchers want to know how populations of social actors can change across time through processes of birth, death, and migration.  In the context of human biological populations, demographic analysis uses administrative records to develop an independent estimate of the population.  Demographic analysis estimates are often considered a reliable standard for judging the accuracy of the census information gathered at any time.  In the labor force, demographic analysis is used to estimate sizes and flows of populations of workers; in population ecology the focus is on the birth, death, migration and immigration of individuals in a population of living organisms, alternatively, in social human sciences could involve movement of firms and institutional forms.  Demographic analysis is used in a wide variety of contexts.  For example, it is often used in business plans, to describe the population connected to the geographic location of the business.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  ""Composition"" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music ""score"", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.', 'In sound recording and reproduction, audio mixing is the process of combining multitrack recordings into a single track.

He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial.  Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.  His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.\nO\'Farrell Community School or The O\'Farrell Charter School (CDE official name) commonly referred to as O\'Farrell is a charter school in the Southeast San Diego neighborhood of Encanto serving grades K-12 in the K-12 American education system.

Upon falling out of favor, he committed suicide.\nLucius Seius Strabo or Lucius Aelius Strabo was a prefect of the Roman imperial bodyguard, known as the Praetorian Guard, during the rule of the emperors Augustus and Tiberius.  The length of Strabo\'s tenure as Praetorian prefect is unknown, but he held the position together with various colleagues until 15, after which he was appointed to the governorship of Egypt.  With this career Strabo distinguished himself by attaining the two highest offices open to men of the equestrian class in the Roman Empire.\nPraetorian prefect (Latin: ""praefectus praetorio"" , Greek: ) was the title of a high office in the Roman Empire.  Originating as the commander of the Praetorian Guard, the office gradually acquired extensive legal and administrative functions, with its holders becoming the Emperor\'s chief aides.  Under Constantine I, the office was much reduced in power and transformed into a purely civilian administrative post, while under his successors, territorially-defined praetorian prefectures emerged as the highest-level administrative division of the Empire.  The prefects again functioned as the chief ministers of the state, with many laws addressed to them by name.  In this role, praetorian prefects continued to be appointed until the reign of Heraclius in the 7th century AD, when wide-ranging reforms reduced its power and converted it to a mere overseer of provincial administration.  The last traces of the prefecture disappeared in the Byzantine Empire by the 840s.\nGaius Nymphidius Sabinus (c. 35–68) was a Prefect of the Praetorian Guard during the rule of Emperor Nero from 65 until his death in 68.  He shared this office together with Gaius Ophonius Tigellinus, replacing his previous colleague Faenius Rufus.  During the second half of the 60s, Nero grew increasingly unpopular with the people and the army, leading to a number of rebellions which ultimately caused his downfall and suicide in 68.  Nymphidius took part in the final conspiracy against Nero and persuaded the Praetorian Guard to desert him, but when he attempted to have himself declared emperor, he was killed by his own soldiers.\nCaligula ( ), properly Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (31 August AD 12 – 24 January AD 41) was Roman emperor from AD 37–41.  Born Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus (not to be confused with Julius Caesar), Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  Caligula\'s biological father was Germanicus, and he was the great-nephew and adopted son of Emperor Tiberius.  The young Gaius earned the nickname ""Caligula"" (meaning ""little soldier\'s boot"", the diminutive form of ""caliga"", hob-nailed military boot) from his father\'s soldiers while accompanying him during his campaigns in Germania.\nClaudia Capitolina (Greek: η Κλαuδία Καπιτωλίνα ) was an Egyptian Greek woman who lived in the Roman Empire, in the 1st century and possibly in the 2nd century.  Capitolina came from a distinguished family of Equestrian rank.  She was born and raised in Alexandria, Egypt.  Capitolina was the daughter and only child of Tiberius Claudius Balbilus by his unnamed wife.  The cognomen ""Capitolina"", is probably from her maternal side.  Her father was one of the highest magistrates of Equestrian rank that served in Rome.  Balbilus was an astrologer and a learned scholar, who was later Prefect of Egypt.  Capitolina’s paternal grandfather, was an Egyptian Greek Grammarian and Astrologer called Thrasyllus of Mendes or Tiberius Claudius Thrasyllus, who was a friend of the Roman Emperor Tiberius, while her paternal grandmother was Greek Princess Aka II of Commagene, who was a great, granddaughter of King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene.

This described the use of a flat metal (other materials are also mentioned) diaphragm in the voice-box (reproducer) of a violin to mechanically amplify the sound.

""Composition"" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music ""score"", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.', 'In sound recording and reproduction, audio mixing is the process of combining multitrack recordings into a single track.

People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music.  In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist.  ""Composition"" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music.  In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music ""score"", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers.  In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.  In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.  In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory.  In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.\nIn sound recording and reproduction, audio mixing is the process of combining multitrack recordings into a single track.  These tracks that are blended together are done so by using various processes such as EQ, Compression and Reverb.  The track may be mixed in mono, stereo, or surround sound.  There are numerous approaches, methods and techniques involved in Audio mixing; some of these practices include levels setting, equalization, stereo panning, and effects.  Audio mixing techniques and approaches can vary widely, and these can greatly affect the qualities of the sound recording.\nGraham Reynolds is an Austin, Texas-based composer-bandleader.

From a young age, he believed alcohol to be the cause of many of society\'s problems and sought to ban it through legislation.  In 1850, Dow was elected president of the Maine Temperance Union, and the next year he was elected mayor of Portland.  Soon after, largely due to Dow\'s efforts, the state legislature banned the sale and production of alcohol in what became known as the Maine law.  Serving twice as mayor of Portland, Dow enforced the law with vigor and called for increasingly harsh penalties for violators.  In 1855, his opponents rioted and he ordered the state militia to fire on the crowd.  One man was killed and several wounded, and when public reaction to the violence turned against Dow, he chose not to seek reelection.\nEdward Cornelius Delavan (1793–1871) was a wealthy businessman who devoted much of his fortune to promoting the temperance movement.  He helped establish the American Temperance Union; attacked the use of wine in Christian communion; established a temperance hotel in Albany, New York; traveled to Europe to promote teetotalism.  He helped spearhead the local option movement in New York during the 1840s by which local majorities could vote their towns dry.  In 1846, he received the nomination for the Governorship of New York from the Native American Party, but he declined it.  He was also active in the Maine Law prohibition movement of the 1850s.  He later sent a copy of a temperance tract to every soldier in the Union Army during the Civil War (a million copies in all); and sponsored a series of periodicals.  They included the ""Journal of the American Temperance Union"", the ""Temperance Recorder"", the ""American Temperance Intelligencer""; the ""Enquirer"", and the ""Prohibitionist"".  Prohibition or dry towns in Illinois and Wisconsin were named in his honor.\nThe Neal Dow House, also known as Gen. Neal Dow House, is an historic house found at 714 Congress Street in Portland, Maine.  It was built in 1829 for noted politician and prohibitionist Neal Dow (1804-1897), and was later designated a National Historic Landmark for that association.  Dow was the author of the first prohibition law passed by the Maine legislature in 1851 (and giving such laws the epithet ""Maine law"").  He was known as a tireless, internationally known activist for the temperance movement.  Dow\'s house was a center of activism in his lifetime, and is now the headquarters of the Maine chapter of the Women\'s Christian Temperance Union.\nThe Missouri Compromise is the title generally attached to the legislation passed by the 16th United States Congress on May 8, 1820.  The measures provided for the admission of Maine as a state along with Missouri as a slave state, thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South.  As part of the compromise, slavery was prohibited North of the 36°30′ parallel, excluding Missouri.  President James Monroe signed the legislation on April 6, 1820.\nThomas Hill Green (7 April 1836 – 15 March 1882) was an English philosopher, political radical and temperance reformer, and a member of the British idealism movement.  Like all the British idealists, Green was influenced by the metaphysical historicism of G.W.F. Hegel.
