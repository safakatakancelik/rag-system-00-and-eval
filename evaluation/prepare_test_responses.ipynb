These methods have primarily been developed to study human populations, but are extended to a variety of areas where researchers want to know how populations of social actors can change across time through processes of birth, death, and migration.  In the context of human biological populations, demographic analysis uses administrative records to develop an independent estimate of the population.  Demographic analysis estimates are often considered a reliable standard for judging the accuracy of the census information gathered at any time.  In the labor force, demographic analysis is used to estimate sizes and flows of populations of workers; in population ecology the focus is on the birth, death, migration and immigration of individuals in a population of living organisms, alternatively, in social human sciences could involve movement of firms and institutional forms.  Demographic analysis is used in a wide variety of contexts.  For example, it is often used in business plans, to describe the population connected to the geographic location of the business.  Demographic analysis is usually abbreviated as DA.  For the 2010 U.S. Census, The U.S. Census Bureau has expanded its DA categories.
