He has been played by actor Drake Hogestyn since 1986, with a break in between from January 2009 to September 2011.  John was created by script writers Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina and Leah Laiman as The Pawn in 1985 and introduced by executive producers Betty Corday and Al Rabin.  John becomes one of ""Days of Our Lives\' "" most popular characters when he is revealed to be the presumed dead Roman Brady (Wayne Northrop) with plastic surgery and amnesia.  However, Northrop\'s return in 1991 led to Hogestyn\'s Roman being retconned into the entirely separate character of John Black, which also establishes the supercouple pairing of John and Marlena, due to John\'s affair with Roman\'s wife, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall).  During the time in which he believes he is Roman, John picks up the mantle of Roman\'s feud with the notorious international criminal Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo).  John and Stefano\'s feud is central to the character\'s history as Stefano is partly responsible for John\'s memory loss.  Their lives are further intertwined in 2008 when the two are falsely led to believe they are half brothers—a story that was later disproved.  Hogestyn\'s portrayal has made him one of daytime\'s most popular and recognizable stars.  Hogestyn was attributed with helping the series out of its ratings slump in the 1980s.
